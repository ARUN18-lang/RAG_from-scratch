# Context-Aware Response Generation using FAISS and GPT-2

This project demonstrates how to build a system for generating context-aware responses using FAISS for document retrieval and GPT-2 for text generation.

## Overview

The system works as follows:

1. **Document Embedding:** Documents are embedded into a vector space using SentenceTransformer.
2. **FAISS Vector DB:** The document embeddings are stored in a FAISS index for efficient similarity search.
3. **Retrieve Relevant Documents:** Given a query, the system retrieves the most similar documents from the FAISS index.
4. **Generate Context-Aware Response:** The retrieved documents are used as context for generating a response using GPT-2.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- faiss-cpu
- sentence-transformers
- sklearn
- transformers
- torch

To install the necessary libraries, run:

bash !pip install faiss-cpu sentence-transformers scikit-learn transformers torch

## Usage

1. Prepare a text file containing your documents, one document per line.
2. Update the file path in the code to point to your document file.
3. Run the code to build the FAISS index and generate responses.

## Notes

- The code uses a pre-trained GPT-2 model for text generation. You can fine-tune the model on your own data for better performance.
- The FAISS index is built using the `IndexFlatL2` class, which is suitable for static documents. For dynamic documents, consider using a hierarchical data structure.
- The code uses cosine similarity to measure the similarity between documents. You can experiment with other similarity metrics.
